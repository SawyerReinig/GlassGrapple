C:\Users\Sawyer\Documents\Android Projects\GlassGrapple\VRGrappleGame\app\build.gradle:11: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 33
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

    implementation 'androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.0.0'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\Users\Sawyer\Documents\Android Projects\GlassGrapple\VRGrappleGame\app\build.gradle:55: Warning: Avoid using + in version numbers; can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds (junit:junit:4.+) [GradleDynamicVersion]
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.+'
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDynamicVersion":
   Using + in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available
   version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not
   recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a
   slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a
   dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using
   it in the minor version position.)

C:\Users\Sawyer\Documents\Android Projects\GlassGrapple\VRGrappleGame\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:40: Warning: Expecting android:resizeableActivity="true" for this activity so the user can take advantage of the multi-window environment on all devices.

              android:resizeableActivity="false"
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NonResizeableActivity":
   The <activity> element should be allowed to be resized to allow users to
   take advantage of the multi-window environments available on larger screen
   Android devices.

   To fix the issue, consider declaring the corresponding activity element
   with resizableActivity="true" attribute.

C:\Users\Sawyer\Documents\Android Projects\GlassGrapple\VRGrappleGame\app\build.gradle:18: Warning: Missing x86 and x86_64 ABI support for ChromeOS [ChromeOsAbiSupport]
                abiFilters 'arm64-v8a'
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ChromeOsAbiSupport":
   To properly support ChromeOS, your Android application should have an x86
   and/or x86_64 binary as part of the build configuration. To fix the issue,
   ensure your files are properly optimized for ARM; the binary translator
   will then ensure compatibility with x86. Alternatively, add an abiSplit for
   x86 within your build.gradle file and create the required x86
   dependencies.

C:\Users\Sawyer\Documents\Android Projects\GlassGrapple\VRGrappleGame\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:16: Warning: The attribute android:allowBackup is deprecated from Android 12 and higher and may be removed in future versions. Consider adding the attribute android:dataExtractionRules specifying an @xml resource which configures cloud backups and device transfers on Android 12 and higher. [DataExtractionRules]
      android:allowBackup="false"
                           ~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DataExtractionRules":
   Before Android 12, the attributes android:allowBackup and
   android:fullBackupContent were used to configure all forms of backup,
   including cloud backups, device-to-device transfers and adb backup.

   In Android 12 and higher, these attributes have been deprecated and will
   only apply to cloud backups. You should instead use the attribute
   android:dataExtractionRules, specifying an @xml resource that configures
   which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device
   transfers, separately. If your minSdkVersion supports older versions,
   you'll still want to specify an android:fullBackupContent resource if the
   default behavior is not right for your app.

C:\Users\Sawyer\Documents\Android Projects\GlassGrapple\VRGrappleGame\app\src\main\res\values\themes.xml:13: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 21 [ObsoleteSdkInt]

                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
