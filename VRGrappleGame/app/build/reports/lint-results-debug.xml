To fix the issue, ensure your files are properly optimized for ARM; the binary translator will then ensure compatibility with x86. Alternatively, add an `abiSplit` for x86 within your `build.gradle` file and create the required x86 dependencies."

        message="As of Android 12, `android:exported` must be set; use `true` to make the activity \&#xA;available to other apps, and `false` otherwise. For launcher activities, this should be set to `true`."
        category="Security"
        priority="5"
        summary="Unspecified `android:exported` in manifest"
        explanation="Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit value for `android:exported` when the corresponding component has an intent filter defined. Otherwise, installation will fail. Set it to `true` to make this activity accessible to other apps, and `false` to limit it to be used only by this app or the OS. For launch activities, this should be set to true; otherwise, the app will fail to launch.&#xA;&#xA;Previously, `android:exported` for components without any intent filters present used to default to `false`, and when intent filters were present, the default was `true`. Defaults which change value based on other values are confusing and lead to apps accidentally exporting components as a side-effect of adding intent filters. This is a security risk, and we have made this change to avoid introducing accidental vulnerabilities.&#xA;&#xA;While the default without intent filters remains unchanged, it is now required to explicitly specify a value when intent filters are present. Any app failing to meet this requirement will fail to install on any Android version after Android 11.&#xA;&#xA;We recommend setting `android:exported` to false (even on previous versions of Android prior to this requirement) unless you have a good reason to export a particular component."
